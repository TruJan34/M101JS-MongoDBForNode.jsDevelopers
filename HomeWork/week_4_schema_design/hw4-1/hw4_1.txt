Hi,

I got answer in first attempt..

Here is my thinking of answer... (use facebook.json)

1 If the number of milestones does not exceed 10 per year

- looks ok as u search inside milestones field, check "stoned_year" how many times it is...

2 if the milestones will never contain more than 15 fields

- it looks good in JSON but think it can contain more fields but there is no limit of adding fields...

3 if the milestones field is always less than 16K

- it looks good in JSON but total size of milestone is 16KB but it can be more if it has more fields..

4 One frequently displayed view of our data displays company details such as the "name", "founded_year", "twitter_username", etc. as well as milestones.

- This is definitly true... as rule of frequency of acces

5 Some of the milestone fields such as "stoneable_type" and "stoneable" are frequently the same from one milestone to another.

- we don't really care about the nature of the fields...

I answered here but you need to undestand it preoprely to find right answer...

Best Luck,
Ankur Patel
